# deep-learning-project-2020

This repo contains the final code for our Deep Learning project 2020.

## Important: Before you run
Before running the cell `Import data and create subsets`, place the two files `wav_lengths.pickle` and `wav_lengths_test.pickle` in your `DybLæring` folder created on your drive. otherwise, you will not be able to recreate the subset of the data, we have used.
